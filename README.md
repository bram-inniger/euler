# Project Euler solutions repository

## IMPORTANT

This repo is in the process of being rewritten to much nicer functional/declarative code.
Furthermore the goal will be to keep both this repository an its [sister repo (euler-kotlin)](https://github.com/bram-inniger/euler-kotlin) in sync.
Code written in 2018 is the new nicer one. Code written in 2016 probably does not reflect my current coding skill and practices.
The 2016 code at the moment has been deleted but can easily be retrieved by going into [the repo history](https://github.com/bram-inniger/euler/commit/7e027185176a542cdcad98da09008459e28f96fc).

## About

A place for me to conveniently story my Project Euler solutions.
Serves also to further practice git, java 11, maven...

## How to read

Each and every problem has its own class file containing the code how to solve it.
Every time a test file accompanies the class containing the actual solution, and validating the code.

## TODO
Solve more problems (or reclaim the old ones and polish them back up)
