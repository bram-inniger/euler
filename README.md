# Project Euler solutions repository

## IMPORTANT

This repo is in the process of being rewritten to much nicer functional/declarative code.
Furthermore the goal will be to keep both this repository an its sister repo (euler-kotlin) in sync. // TODO add link
Code written in 2018 is the new nicer one. Code written in 2016 probably does not reflect my current coding skill an practices.

## About

A place for me to conveniently story my Project Euler solutions.
Serves also to further practice git, java 8, maven...

## How to read

Each and every problem has its own class file containing the code how to solve it.
Every time a test file accompanies the class containing the actual solution, and validating the code.
