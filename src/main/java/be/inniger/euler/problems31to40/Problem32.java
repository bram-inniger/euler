/**
 * Problem from Project Euler:
 * <p>
 * We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
 * The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

   * The idea is simple: generate all possible 9 digit permutations and check if the permutation can be formed in a way to create a valid product.
   * As we start by using only the permutations, and nothing else, we know a priori that whatever our findings, it will be a pandigital set of multiplicand, multiplier and product.
   * Now simply add up all the (unique) products so far and we have our answer.

   * The actual solving implementation.
   *
   * A first essential observation to take into account:
   * if we have 9 digits to divide over "a * b = c", then the #c (nr. of digits of "c") has to be equal to or larger than #a.
   * Thus "a" cannot have more than 4 digits in any case.
   * This information is captured in the variable "longestL", and used in the outer-most for-loop.
   * ==> #a <= 4
   *
   * Secondly, say both a and b have 2 digits, how many digits does c then have?
   * Best case a=10 and b=10, meaning c=100 -> 3 digits
   * Worst case a=99 and b=99, thus c=9801 -> 4 digits
   *
   * This means that #c = #a + #b (worst case) OR #a + #b - 1 (best case).
   * Combined with the fact above that #c >= #a, we can say that
   *      #c >= #a + #b -1     AND    #c <= #a + #b
   *      #a + #b + #c = 9
   *      #c >= #a
   *
   * Solving for #b this gives us: (this is expressed in the inner for-loop)
   * ==> #b <= 9/2 - #a + 1
   *
   *
   * Simply take every permutation, and split it up over every possible combination of "a" and "b", checking if what is left of the digits equals "a * b".
   * The actual checking of all combinations of "a" and "b" follows the constraints defined above.
   *
   * @return A Collection containing all unique 9 digits pandigital products.
