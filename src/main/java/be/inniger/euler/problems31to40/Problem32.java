/**
 * Problem from Project Euler:
 * <p>
 * We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
 * The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
 * HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

   * Implemented a rather un-elegant method:
   * Just try all multiplicand / multiplies combinations, then verify if the concatenated identity is pandigital or not.
   * Once again we will store the results in a HashSet to get "free" de-duplication.
   *
   * A neater solution could be:
   * 1. create a collection holding all digits from 1 to 9.
   * 2. try all permutations of this connection over both multiplicand and multiplier
   * 3. simply check if the product contains the digits not yet permuted over, if they match then the number is by definition pandigital

  /**
   * There are three optimisations to use:
   * 1. Say "a * b = c", and all the digits from 1 to 9 are in play once and once only.
   *    Then if a contains 5 digits, b still has to contain at least 1, leaving 3 digits for the product.
   *    A product of a 5 digit number and a 1 digit number cannot have less than 5 digits itself.
   *    So it is easy to see that both a and b have to be between 1 and 4 digits long.
   * 2. Following the above a and b have to be between 1 (the lowest possible value) and 9876 (the highest possible value without repeating digits, that is 4 digits long)
   * 3. Combining the above 2 it pays up to pre-compute all the integers between 1 and 9876 that do not contain any repeating digits, this allows to not even perform the relatively expensive "isPandigital" check in many cases
