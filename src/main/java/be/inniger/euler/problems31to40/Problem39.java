  /**
   * We will observe / enforce the following facts / rules:
   *
   * 0. a, b and c are larger than 0, otherwise it wouldn't be a triangle.
   * 1. p = a + b + c (this is how circles work)
   * 2. a and b will be the sides on the right angle, c will be the slanted (always longest) side -> a*a + b*b = c*c
   * 3. a <= b < c (for any a and b > 0, c has has to be larger than both a and b).
   *
   *
   * Following the rules above we can set up some nice bounds for our problem space.
   *
   * For a:
   * If   "a +  b + c = p"                  (rule 1)
   * and  "a <= b < c    "                  (rule 3)
   * then "a +  a + a < p" OR "a < p / 3"
   *
   * Combined with rule 0 we can say that a is bounded from 1 up to p/3 (exclusive)
   *
   *
   * For b:
   * If                   "a + b + c = p"         (rule 1)
   * then                 "    b + c < p"
   * We already know that "    b < c    " (rule 3)
   * Thus                 "    b + b < p" OR "b < p / 2"
   *
   * Combined with rule 3 again, we can say that b is bounded from a up p/2 (exclusive)
   *
   *
   * All that remains is try all of the combinations of a and b, for all possible p values.
   * Now verify that "a*a + b*b = c*c" (and "c > b") -> solution found.
   * Note that, as "p/3" and "p/2" can produce non integer numbers, we still need to bound a and b up to the rounded down values inclusive.
