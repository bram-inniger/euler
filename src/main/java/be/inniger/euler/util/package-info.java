/**
 * Utility classes used in this project.
 * <p>
 * A utility class:
 * - is final so it cannot be extended;
 * - has no state whatsoever;
 * - has only static utility methods and companion interfaces, e.g. {@link be.inniger.euler.util.CollectionUtil.ProblemTransformer};
 * - all methods are pure functions (i.e. do not have side effects);
 * - cannot be instantiated, and should thus have a no-args private throwing constructor, to deter instantiation by reflection.
