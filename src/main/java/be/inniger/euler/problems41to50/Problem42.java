/**
 * Problem from Project Euler:
 * <p>
 * The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:
 * 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
 * By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t_10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
 * Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle words?
 * <p>
 * N.B. To keep in line with the rest of this repository the file was renamed from "words.txt" to "Problem42.txt".
